# Sorting algorithms and Big O notation
The goal of this project is to implement various sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort and Quick sort. It also provides time and space complexities for each algorithm

## Case Implementation
### Bubble sort

> int array[] = {19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7};

> print_array(array)

19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7

> bubble_sort(array)

7, 13, 19, 48, 52, 71, 73, 86, 96, 99
